What to expect? When I first started working as a Baby speaker, a lot a people told me that it was going to be an amazing experience and it sure was! I was pretty nervous at first, but Speaking- Agency prepared me through courses and guided me over the entire process, from my application to finding the perfect family for me. The best part about the job? Flexible hours! Thanks to Speaking-Agency, I planned my work time according to my availability, and I no longer had to worry about moving my schedule. Every day is unique and different, and so are the kid you’ll get to take care of ! *My challenges Taking care of daily childcare tasks, such as bathing, giving meals, both outdoors and indoors fun activities, homework, etc. There is no typical day with Speaking-Agency! What did I learn? I learned a lot of soft skills such as being practical,punctual, patient and respectful. I will be able to use those skills daily, both in private and in my future professional life! Babysitting is more than a part-time job or a way to earn money. It’s a human experience based on trust and sharing between you, the families and the kids that you will look after. What requirements needed? Patience, discipline, reliability and good communications skills. #childcare #babysitter #nannyjobs #studentjobs Job Types: Part-time, Contract Salary: 11.50€ to 14.00€ /hour
